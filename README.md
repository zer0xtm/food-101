# food-101
This is the Food 101 dataset, also available from https://www.vision.ee.ethz.ch/datasets_extra/food-101/


It contains images of food, organized by type of food. It was used in the Paper "Food-101 â€“ Mining Discriminative Components with Random Forests" by Lukas Bossard, Matthieu Guillaumin and Luc Van Gool. It's a good (large dataset) for testing computer vision techniques.
